# Foresight AI - Missing Person Detection System

Foresight AI is an offline, AI-powered missing person detection system that leverages advanced face recognition and mask detection algorithms to analyze CCTV footage. It is optimized for modest hardware, such as the ASUS VivoBook Go 15 (AMD Ryzen 3 5300U, 8GB RAM), and built using Python with libraries like OpenCV, face_recognition, and CustomTkinter.

---

## Features

- **Face Recognition & Mask Detection:**  
  Uses deep learning–based face recognition to compare faces in video footage with provided reference images, and applies a heuristic to detect mask usage.

- **Performance Optimizations:**  
  - Frame skipping to reduce computation.  
  - Optimized video processing for lower RAM usage.  

- **User-Friendly GUI:**  
  Built with CustomTkinter (dark theme) with:
  - Video preview and progress tracking.
  - Control buttons for Start, Pause, and Stop.
  - Dashboard for detailed detection results.

- **Task-Based File Organization:**  
  On creating a new task via the GUI, a folder is automatically created (under a common `tasks` folder) with subdirectories:
  - `detected_faces`: for saving detected face images.
  - `reports`: for generated reports (text/CSV).
  - `temp`: for temporary video clips.
  - `reference_image`: for storing reference images.
  - `cctv_footage`: for copying the original video.

- **Offline Operation:**  
  The system runs fully offline without any additional software requirements.

## Usage

1. **Create a New Task:**
   - Launch the application:
     ```sh
     python main.py
     ```
   - Enter a task name in the provided field and click **Create New Task**.  
     This creates the required folder structure under the `tasks` directory.

2. **Select Input Files:**
   - **Video:** Click **Select Video** to choose a CCTV footage file.
   - **Reference Images:** Click **Select Reference Images (Max 4)** to select images of the missing person.

3. **Start Detection:**
   - Click **Start Detection** to begin processing.  
   - Use the **Pause** and **Stop** buttons as needed.
   - The progress bar and video preview update in real time.

4. **View Results:**
   - Once detection is complete, view detailed results in the results textbox.
   - Click **Show Dashboard** to open a summary window with detection details such as:
     - Total detections
     - Detections with/without mask
     - Confidence scores
     - Timestamps and image paths

5. **Review Task Outputs:**
   - All outputs are saved in the task-specific folder created under `tasks/{TaskName}`.
